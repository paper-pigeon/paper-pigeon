# 👋 Hey, I’m Misha!
### Here’s some quick info to get to know me:

- 🤠 As the saying goes, I wear many hats! Some roles I might fill in my day-to-day are…
    - Champlain College Online student 🎓
    - Daycare staff 🧢
    - Theater staff 🎭
    - Workshop staff 👷
    - Freelance illustrator 👩‍🎨
- 👩‍💻 I’m learning Web Development and Design
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end…
    - particularly web accessibility! 💪
- ✨ **Fun fact:** my first coding project was a hilariously bad space invaders rip off that I put together in game maker studio when I was in middle school, complete with a png of my cat’s head as the player character.
